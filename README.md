# Movie-Recommender-System
I created a content-based movie recommendation system for this project. The algorithm makes suggestions for products that are comparable to those that a consumer has previously enjoyed. We compute this similarity (often cosine similarity) using both the information we have about the goods and the user's previous choices.

Content-based filtering: Based on a specific item, they offer related items. To generate these recommendations, this system leverages item metadata, such as the genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies. These recommender systems work under the premise that if a user enjoyed one item, they will also enjoy another similar.
